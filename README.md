Purpose:

specific instruction to practice the use of timers.

Instructions: 
The game is self explanatory upon loading.

Getting Started:
Just load index.html and click away!

Technical Approach: This game uses only HTM, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery. The user starts the game and 1 question at a time
appears on screen. Each question is saved locally as an object with 4 answers, a picture link, and a related fact. Each answer is stored with its text and an additional value of correcet or incorrect. The answer order is displayed on screen randomly. A count down timer ensures the game progresses. After each question, the user is show the correct answer, whether they were correct or incorrect, the related fact, and a related picture. At the end, the users stats are shown.
